# Reactrix

Reactrix is an analytical prototyping tool for developers to not only rapidly produce React component trees, but to also determine what structures may lead to the most optimal performance.

Reactrix brings together the commodity of prototyping with a drag and drop feature, allowing users to build out their component trees, and the ability to quickly assess the performance of their applications.

Main Features:
* Drag N’ Drop Component Tree - Architect your application structure by dragging and dropping components into the component tree. View and rearrange parent/sibling/children relationships.
* Component Library - Create reusable components and store them across sessions in the component library. Drag reusable components from the library and drop them into the component tree to use them.
* App Preview - Render your application into a preview with full interactions.
* Component Profiling - Profile your application’s initial render performance.
* Save Snapshots - Save your application structure and performance profile locally.
* Snapshot Comparisons - Compare between snapshot performance profiles.

Getting Started!
1. Users will access this tool by first cloning the repo

`npm install`

3. Run the application with command node dev.js

`node dev.js`

4. Sign-in with either GitHub or guest login
5. Jump right in and start detailing out components!
6. Drag and Drop new components or saved components onto App in the Component Tree
7. Check performance metrics by clicking Start Profiling and Stop Profiling
8. Save snapshots of the metrics by clicking Take Snapshot
9. Compare and contrast the different snapshots by rendering saved snaps onto the bar graph
